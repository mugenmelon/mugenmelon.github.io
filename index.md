A software engineer trying his hand at one-man-army game development.  
I work on an action RPG prototype in Unreal Engine and share progress via devlogs. I also post useful and crazy ideas on programming, game design and architecture.

For questions or feedback contact me through any of the linked channels. I also take requests for tutorials, so reach out!
