Software engineer exploring game development as a craft.

I am developing a single-player action RPG prototype in Unreal Engine and post about:
- 📐 Problem-solving and design patterns
- 🛠️ Advanced and unconventional game programming techniques  
- 🎮 AI and emergent gameplay system design

I also make occasional posts about programming & software development in general.
