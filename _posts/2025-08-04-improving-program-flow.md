# The Problem in C++

I have often seen and implemented functions like these:

```cs
bool GetAttackPower(const AActor* OwnerActor, float& OutAttackPower)
{
    if (IsValid(OwnerActor))
    {
        // Some logic to get the attack power with possibly more conditions
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

At first glance that seems pretty standard and harmless. Here is how we might use it:

```cs
float AttackPower;
if (GetAttackPower(OwnerActor, AttackPower))
{
    ApplyDamageToSelf(AttackPower);
}
```

Do you see an issue here?

## Out Parameter

As a caller of this function we are forced to declare and pass an extra variable to retrieve the `AttackPower`.
That may not sound like much of an issue aside from the aesthetic aspect. But what is stopping us from doing bad things like this?

```cs
float AttackPower;
// I either forgot the if, or I unknowingly decided it is not necessary
GetAttackPower(OwnerActor, AttackPower);
ApplyDamageToSelf(AttackPower);
```

The value of `AttackPower` here is unpredictable - it depends entirely on whether `GetAttackPower` **succeeded** or **failed**.
Because the variable is uninitialized it contains garbage memory.
If `GetAttackPower` **fails** we apply a random value in our damage calculation, causing a hard to track bug. Ouch!

## Readability

Readable code is preferable to less readable code. And part of readability is using appropriate words and correct grammar.

Take another look at our function call:

```cs
float AttackPower;
if (GetAttackPower(OwnerActor, AttackPower))
```

Read it aloud: "If get attack power." The grammar is awkward and makes it harder to follow.
A better approach is to encode the unreliability of the function in its name:

```cs
float AttackPower;
if (TryGetAttackPower(OwnerActor, AttackPower))
```

This slightly pollutes our function name but provides context on appropriate usage.
Most importantly it points to a more crucial issue.

## Semantics

This is the crux: return values are unnamed. Parameters have names like `OwnerActor` that tell us exactly what they represent.
But what does `bool` mean here? We can't know with certainty. 
The function could return `true` if AttackPower > 0, or maybe it indicates physical vs magical damage. A `bool` is not self-documenting.

Often you can find this information in the function's comment:

```cs
// Returns true if OwnerActor has AttackPower, else false.
bool GetAttackPower(const AActor* OwnerActor, float& OutAttackPower)
```

But why the inconsistency? Why take great effort with self-documenting function names, parameters, variables etc. 
but use a "band-aid" for the return value?

Also how do we know the comment is up-to-date? Maybe the author changed it recently and forgot to update the comment?
Maybe the author misunderstood what it does in the first place and wrote incorrect documentation?
The truth is in the code, not in the comment.

Can we make our return value self-documenting instead?

# Enter `TOptional`

Many programming languages have addressed this issue in multiple ways. UE5 does so with `TOptional`.
Here is how to use it:

```cs
TOptional<float> GetAttackPower(const AActor* OwnerActor)
{
    if (IsValid(OwnerActor))
    {
        // Using a trivial implementation here
        return 100.0f;
    }
    // This essentially resolves to an "empty" Optional instance of any type. 
    // If you prefer you can return "TOptional<float>()" or "{}".
    return NullOpt;
}

// Explicitly querying the optional
const TOptional<float> AttackPower = GetAttackPower(OwnerActor);
if (AttackPower.IsSet())
{
    ApplyDamageToSelf(AttackPower.GetValue());
}

// Another shorter alternative
if (const TOptional<float> AttackPower = GetAttackPower(OwnerActor))
{
    ApplyDamageToSelf(AttackPower.GetValue());
}

// Usage with a default fallback value
ApplyDamageToSelf(GetAttackPower(OwnerActor).Get(10.0f));
```

The point of `TOptional` is to *force* the caller to check it or to provide a fallback value.
If you attempt to call `GetValue` on an empty `TOptional` your program will crash. Deservedly. 
This makes for safer (and in my opinion more aesthetically pleasing) function design. A user *cannot* use the function in a wrong way.

**Caution!**
You can overengineer your functions with `TOptional`. It is likely not appropriate to use it with the following return types:
- Types that already model failure
    - pointers -> `nullptr`
    - indices -> `INDEX_NONE`
    - some structs -> e.g. `FGameplayTag::EmptyTag`
- Types that are expensive to copy, but this is the same limitation as out parameters

But what about functions that have no out parameters?

## Not a Silver Bullet

Let's have a look at a naive implementation of the `ApplyDamageToSelf` function:

```cs
bool ApplyDamageToSelf(const float DamageAmount)
{
    if (!IsInvincible() && !IsDead())
    {
        // Some damage application logic here with possibly more conditions
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

The same semantic problem applies to this function. We don't see at a glance what the returned `bool` represents.
If we applied `TOptional` here we would get:

```cs
TOptional<bool> ApplyDamageToSelf(const float DamageAmount)
{
    // ...
}

// This only checks if the Optional is set
if (const TOptional<bool> DamageApplied = ApplyDamageToSelf(100.0f))
{
    // This actually checks if the Optional contains the value `true`
    if (DamageApplied.GetValue())
    {
        // Play hit animation etc...
    }
}
```

Using `TOptional<bool>` like this can be a source of bugs, aside from not really making much sense in this instance.

So how can we make this function self-documenting without `TOptional`?

# Result Enum

In my project I declared the following global enum for these exact cases:

```cs
UENUM()
enum class EResult
{
    Failure,
    Success
};

bool IsSuccess(const EResult Value)
{
    return Value == EResult::Success;
}
```

Then I replaced all `bool` return values that represent vague failure semantics with this explicit enum:

```cs
EResult ApplyDamageToSelf(const float DamageAmount)
{
    if (!IsInvincible() && !IsDead())
    {
        // Some damage application logic here with possibly more conditions
        return EResult::Success;
    }
    return EResult::Failure;
}

// Either use it with the provided function
if (IsSuccess(ApplyDamageToSelf(100.0f)))
{
    // Do other stuff
}

// Or compare directly
if (ApplyDamageToSelf(100.0f) == EResult::Success)
{
    // Do other stuff
}
```

Now we have an appropriately self-documenting function.
Much like `TOptional` it shows that the function has explicit failure semantics that need to be handled. No more vague `bool`.
In the [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section we will explore a few more useful patterns.

Now let's have a look at the Blueprint side of things.

# The Problem & Solution in Blueprint

Let's see what our previous example looks like in Blueprint:

![Blueprint base example]({{ '/assets/images/posts/improving-program-flow/blueprint-base-example.png' | relative_url }})

Each Blueprint function node requires us to use a branch node and check the bool before we can continue. 
Additionally, we have to use reroute nodes to keep the wires clean. The more functions you chain the more convoluted this becomes.
Intricate failure handling, explicit branch nodes and reroute nodes quickly add up and cause unnecessary cognitive load.

Before we continue I have some bad news first. `TOptional` is C++ only and not supported by Blueprint.
But I have some good news, too! The solution described in [Result Enum](#result-enum) is exactly what we need here.

## Adjusting the Result Enum for Blueprint

First we have to make a few adjustments to the enum:

```cs
UENUM(BlueprintType)
enum class EResult
{
    Success = 1,
    Failure = 0
};
```

1. We added the `BlueprintType` specifier to make it compatible with Blueprint.
2. The order of the enum values is important, I recommend `Success` coming first. I will explain why in the next section.
3. If we change the order we should define `Success` as 1 and `Failure` as 0. I will explain why in [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) and [Implicit Failure in Blueprint](#implicit-failure-in-blueprint).

## ExpandEnumAsExec

The `UFUNCTION` meta specifier `ExpandEnumAsExec` is incredibly useful for our case.
We specify it in our `UFUNCTION` as follows:

```cs
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, meta=(ExpandEnumAsExecs="ReturnValue"))
static EResult GetAttackPower(const AActor* OwnerActor, float& OutAttackPower)
{
    // Simplified implementation
    OutAttackPower = 10.0f;
    return EResult::Success;
}

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, meta=(ExpandEnumAsExecs="ReturnValue"))
static EResult ApplyDamageToSelf(const float DamageAmount)
{
    // Simplified implementation
    return EResult::Success;
}
```

Which causes the returned enum to get "unpacked" into execution pins on our nodes:

![Blueprint ExpandEnumAsExec]({{ '/assets/images/posts/improving-program-flow/blueprint-expand-enum-as-exec.png' | relative_url }})

Much like with `TOptional` the user is forced to make a conscious decision here to handle failure semantics. All in a tidy and compact package. Neat!
And we can also see why I recommend `Success` to be the first value in our `EResult`, because the pins get created in order of declaration.
Most of the time we want our "green path" to flow neatly from left to right instead of branching off.

Blueprint-only users are out of luck: `ExpandEnumAsExec` is C++ exclusive as far as I know.
However the `EResult` enum still gives us better semantics than a `bool`. You simply have to employ a plain old switch-case node:

![Blueprint-only function]({{ '/assets/images/posts/improving-program-flow/blueprint-only-function.png' | relative_url }})

There is also an `ExpandBoolAsExec` specifier that does the same thing if for whatever reason you prefer to keep `bool`.
Personally I think it obstructs complex logical operations so I do not use it.

# Advanced Usage

## Adapting UE Internal Functions

Many UE internal functions use plain `bool` return values for indicating success/failure.
To avoid propagating those to our own code base we can provide a simple conversion utility:

```cpp
template <typename ValueType>
EResult SuccessIfTrue(const ValueType Value)
{
    return Value ? EResult::Success : EResult::Failure;
}
```

Also useful for converting logical expressions to a result:

```cs
return SuccessIfTrue(MyArray.Num() > 0);
```

## Advanced Control Flow with Iterables

In programming and game development we are often operating on an *array* of data rather than just a single instance.
One operation I frequently apply is fallback logic: Keep iterating an array as long as the operation is failing.

Let's take our previous example here. For whatever reason we want to find and apply the damage of only the first valid owner actor:

```cs
EResult ApplyDamageOfAnyActor(const TArray<AActor*>& OwnerActors)
{
    EResult Result = EResult::Failure;
    for (const AActor* OwnerActor : OwnerActors)
    {
        if (const TOptional<float> AttackDamage = GetAttackDamage(OwnerActor))
        {
            if (IsSuccess(ApplyDamageToSelf(AttackDamage.GetValue()))
            {
                Result = EResult::Success;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return Result;
}
```

We keep trying each owner actor in order of occurrence until one succeeds to apply its damage.
This gives us valuable fallback semantics (if first one doesn't work then try second one, if second one doesn't work try third one...) but the function body does not make this obvious.
In my project I opted to provide the following utility for these cases:

```cs
template <typename IterableType, typename CallableType>
EResult AnySucceed(IterableType&& Iterable, const CallableType& Callable)
{
    for (auto& Element : Iterable)
    {
       if (IsSuccess(Callable(Element)))
       {
           return EResult::Success;
       }
    }
    return EResult::Failure;
}
```

Which makes fallback/any semantics readily apparent:

```cs
EResult ApplyDamageOfAnyActor(const TArray<AActor*>& OwnerActors)
{
    return AnySucceed(OwnerActors, [this](const AActor* OwnerActor)
    {
        const TOptional<float> AttackDamage = GetAttackDamage(OwnerActor);
        return AttackDamage.IsSet() ? ApplyDamageToSelf(AttackDamage.GetValue()) : EResult::Failure;
    });
}
```

And the best thing: This works with *any* iterable type, not just `TArray`!

```cs
EResult DoSomethingWithFirstSuccessfulGameplayTag(const FGameplayTagContainer& Container)
{
    return AnySucceed(Container, [this](const FGameplayTag Tag)
    {
        return DoSomethingThatCanFailWithTag(Tag);
    });
}
```

## Free Conversion of `TOptional` to Blueprint

In [The Problem & Solution in Blueprint](#the-problem--solution-in-blueprint) we established that `TOptional` is not
supported in Blueprint and that we can instead use `EResult`, `ExpandEnumAsExec` and out parameters to get a similar effect.

The following utility function makes it *very easy* to wrap a C++ function returning `TOptional` and convert it into the Blueprint-compatible flow:

```cs
template <typename ValueType>
EResult SuccessIfSet(const TOptional<ValueType> Optional, ValueType& OutValue)
{
    if (Optional)
    {
        OutValue = Optional.GetValue();
        return EResult::Success;
    }
    return EResult::Failure;
}
```

Given our prior C++ function:

```cs
TOptional<float> GetAttackPower(const AActor* OwnerActor)
{
    return IsValid(OwnerActor) ? 100.0f : TOptional<float>();
}
```

We can easily wrap it for Blueprint compatibility:

```cs
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, meta=(ExpandEnumAsExec="ReturnValue"))
EResult BP_GetAttackPower(const AActor* OwnerActor, float& OutAttackPower)
{
    return SuccessIfSet(GetAttackPower(OwnerActor), OutAttackPower);
}
```

## Implicit Failure in Blueprint

In [Adjusting the Result Enum for Blueprint](#adjusting-the-result-enum-for-blueprint) and [ExpandEnumAsExec](#expandenumasexec) I recommended to declare `Success` first for better Blueprint flow.
This has an uncomfortable side effect: C++ initializes the first declared enum with 0. And Blueprint initializes enum variables with 0. Therefore using `EResult` in Blueprint will make it default to `Success`.
Because of this you will have to explicitly return `Failure` in a return node. This is different from `bool` variables where `false` is the default.

Have a look at this function:

![Blueprint explicit failure]({{ '/assets/images/posts/improving-program-flow/blueprint-explicit-failure.png' | relative_url }})

By default this function will return `Success` i.e. for unconnected exec pins. But the `Failure` case is much more frequent than the `Success` case.
And for functions with complex failure handling this adds up into either a lot of `Failure` return nodes or a lot of wires to a single node.

To alleviate this issue we make `Failure` the default instead:

```cs
UENUM(BlueprintType)
enum class EResult
{
    Success = 1,    // This must be returned explicitly
    Failure = 0     // This is now the implicit value for Blueprint
};
```

Which makes our function more streamlined:

![Blueprint implicit failure]({{ '/assets/images/posts/improving-program-flow/blueprint-implicit-failure.png' | relative_url }})

The unconnected `False` pin now automatically returns `Failure`. Nice!

# Final Thoughts

Complexity management and maintainable code is not about what's in your brain but rather what you can leave out of it.  
The best function is one that *cannot* fail. The second best is one that openly tells you it can.
