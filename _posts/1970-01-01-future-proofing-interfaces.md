Unreal Engine's `UInterface` is powerful, but adding Blueprint support often leads to fragile call patterns scattered throughout your codebase. This post shows a simple wrapper pattern that keeps your interface calls clean and provides a painless migration path when you need Blueprint compatibility in the future.

# `UInterface`

Interfaces are a powerful abstraction mechanism. They are ideal for modeling imperative communication between different systems while avoiding the rigidity of inheritance. Most programming languages provide some way to write interfaces, and so does C++ with pure virtual functions. But for full compatibility, Unreal Engine has a built-in `UInterface` class, which brings a few awkward things with it when it comes to Blueprint compatibility. Here is how I smooth out interfaces for both C++ and Blueprint. But first, here is a short recap on how to use `UInterface`.

## Quick Recap

Say we wanted to have various pieces of equipment like items, weapons, and armor in our game that can be equipped to a character. A data asset `UEquipmentAsset` defines *how* a piece of equipment gets equipped, what it looks like, and which socket it gets attached to. But how do we add this data asset to our various in-game items without a rigid inheritance hierarchy?
By using an interface `IEquippable` that provides us with a `UEquipmentAsset` we can make *any* class equippable, regardless of whether it is an item, weapon, or armor.

We declare a `UInterface` by using the `UINTERFACE` macro and 2 separate class declarations.

```cpp
UINTERFACE(BlueprintType)
class UEquippable : public UInterface
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};

class IEquippable
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset() const;
};
```

To use the interface, we only need to inherit from `IEquippable` and implement the function in any of our classes.

```cpp
UCLASS()
class AEquippableActor : public AActor, public IEquippable
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    // Concrete implementation omitted for brevity.
    virtual const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset() const override;
};
```

Then we can cast any object to `IEquippable` and get the required asset by calling `GetEquipmentAsset`.

```cpp
if (const IEquippable* Equippable = Cast<IEquippable>(SomeObject))
{
    if (const UEquipmentAsset* EquipmentAsset = Equippable->GetEquipmentAsset())
    {
        // SomeObject is equippable, execute equipment logic...
    }
}
```

![Blueprint interface cast]({{ '/assets/images/posts/future-proofing-interfaces/01-blueprint-interface-cast.png' | relative_url }})

At no point do we get an error here. We are safely checking that `SomeObject` is indeed equippable before getting the asset. This is an important detail when it comes to...

## The Blueprint Question

Let us take stock: We have an interface that can be *implemented* in C++ and *called* in both C++ and Blueprint. But what if we want to *implement* the interface in Blueprint? To make a `UInterface` implementable in Blueprint, we have to mark the `UINTERFACE` as `BlueprintType` (which we already have) and then mark the `UFUNCTION` as `BlueprintNativeEvent`.

```cpp
UINTERFACE(BlueprintType)
class UEquippable : public UInterface
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};

class IEquippable
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent, BlueprintCallable)
    const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset() const;
};
```

An implementing C++ class must now be adjusted in the following way.

```cpp
UCLASS()
class AEquippableActor : public AActor, public IEquippable
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    // BlueprintNativeEvent requires an overrid of "GetEquipmentAsset_Implementation".
    // Overriding "GetEquipmentAsset" alone will not work!
    virtual const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset_Implementation() const override;
};
```

We can now add this interface to any Blueprint's class settings, which gives us the option to then implement `GetEquipmentAsset` within that Blueprint.

![Blueprint interface class settings]({{ '/assets/images/posts/future-proofing-interfaces/02-blueprint-interface-class-settings.png' | relative_url }})

But if we try to call `GetEquipmentAsset` like in [Quick Recap](#quick-recap), we will get an error: `Do not directly call Event functions in Interfaces. Call Execute_GetEquipmentAsset instead`. This is the case with all `BlueprintNativeEvent` and `BlueprintImplementableEvent` functions. They must always be called by using the static `IEquippable::Execute_GetEquipmentAsset` function.
We also have to make sure this static function is only ever called on objects that *actually implement the interface*. Attempting to call it on anything else results in another error. Here is how we can handle it correctly.

```cpp
// Instead of Cast() we use Implements().
// Careful! This must be UEquippable, not IEquippable!
if (IsValid(SomeObject) && SomeObject->Implements<UEquippable>())
{
    // Only now is it safe to call Execute_GetEquipmentAsset.
    if (const UEquipmentAsset* EquipmentAsset = IEquippable::Execute_GetEquipmentAsset(SomeObject))
    {
        // SomeObject is equippable, execute equipment logic...
    }
}
```

This circumstance makes it a bit "boilerplatey" to add Blueprint support to a `UInterface`, especially if we use it in many places. And personally I always try to avoid redundant nesting and `if` clauses to keep functions easy to read. There is a very simple convention that addresses both of these issues.

# Future-Proofing `UInterface`

The idea is straightforward: we want to call `GetEquipmentAsset`, but the way we have to call it may change, right? Then how about wrapping those checks and the function call in a central place so we only ever have to change it once? The most cohesive place to do so is in a static function on the interface itself.

## Static Function Wrapper

For the sake of demonstration, we will go back to our C++-only interface from [Quick Recap](#quick-recap). We write a new static function that wraps the interface function call.

```cpp
class IEquippable
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    // Our static function wrapper.
    static const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset(const UObject* Target);

    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset() const;
};
```

```cpp
// Implementation of our static function wrapper.
const UEquipmentAsset* IEquippable::GetEquipmentAsset(const UObject* Target)
{
    // Instead of spreading Cast() calls throughout the codebase we cast just once here.
    const IEquippable* Equippable = Cast<IEquippable>(GetValid(Target));
    // Then we return sensible defaults where possible.
    return Equippable ? Equippable->GetEquipmentAsset() : nullptr;
}
```
*This works nicely for return types that have a sentinel value like `nullptr`. If you want to know how to best handle other return types, check out my post on [Improving Program Flow In UE5 C++ & Blueprint]({% post_url 2025-08-04-improving-program-flow %}).*

Usage of `IEquippable` becomes much simpler and safer.

```cpp
if (const UEquipmentAsset* EquipmentAsset = IEquippable::GetEquipmentAsset(SomeObject))
{
    // SomeObject is equippable, execute equipment logic...
}
```

## Easy Blueprint Compatibility

In addition to that, we get a very clear migration path to support Blueprint implementations of this interface.

```cpp
class IEquippable
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    static const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset(const UObject* Target);

    // We add BlueprintNativeEvent.
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintNativeEvent, BlueprintCallable)
    const UEquipmentAsset* GetEquipmentAsset() const;
};
```

```cpp
// We only have to adjust our static wrapper function.
const UEquipmentAsset* IEquippable::GetEquipmentAsset(const UObject* Target)
{
    // Instead of using Cast() we use Implements() and Unreal's generated Execute_GetEquipmentAsset function.
    return IsValid(Target) && Target->Implements<UEquippable>() ? Execute_GetEquipmentAsset(Target) : nullptr;
}
```

That is all; no other code changes are required anywhere for full Blueprint support! Neat! We gain some nice benefits on the C++ side at the cost of a static function call:

- ‚úîÔ∏è Single point of change for interface calling logic
- ‚úîÔ∏è Reduced boilerplate (`Cast<IEquippable>()` & `Implements<UEquippable()`)
- ‚úîÔ∏è Safe `nullptr` handling
- ‚úîÔ∏è Less nesting & cognitive load

But you may want to reconsider this pattern if you intend to call *multiple* functions from the same interface!

# Final Thoughts

A short no-brainer this time, but even small improvements can have compounding effects on code readability, cognitive load, and especially our motivation to keep working on our projects!
